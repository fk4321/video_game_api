## In this project, I build up a Gamestore RESTful API with Express using try/catch blocks

## With the help of tools like Postman, you can: 
1. Get all video games
2. Get video games by ID.
3. Add video games.
4. Update video games by ID.
5. Delete video games by ID.

## Work in Progress: Creating a front end for the Gamestore using Vite
